                     <h2>1. What is cryptocurrency?</h2>
                     <p>Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for goods and services. Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the good or service that the company provides. Think of them as you would arcade tokens or casino chips. You’ll need to exchange real currency for the cryptocurrency to access the good or service. Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized technology spread across many computers that manages and records transactions. Part of the appeal of this technology is its security.</p>

                     <p>More than 10,000 different cryptocurrencies are traded publicly, according to CoinMarketCap.com, a market research website. And cryptocurrencies continue to proliferate, raising money through initial coin offerings, or ICOs. The total value of all cryptocurrencies on May 27, 2021, was more than $1.7 trillion — down from April high of $2.2 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. The total value of all bitcoins, the most popular digital currency, was pegged at about $735 billion — down from April high of $1.2 trillion.</p>

                     <h2>3. Why are cryptocurrencies so popular?</h2>
                     <p>Cryptocurrencies appeal to their supporters for a variety of reasons. Here are some of the most popular:
                     <ul>
						<li>Supporters see cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as the currency of the future and are racing to buy them now, presumably before they become more valuable</li>
						<li>Some supporters like the fact that cryptocurrency removes central banks from managing the money supply, since over time these banks tend to reduce the value of money via inflation</li>
						<li>Other supporters like the technology behind cryptocurrencies, the blockchain, because it’s a decentralized processing and recording system and can be more secure than traditional payment systems</li>
						<li>Some speculators like cryptocurrencies because they’re going up in value and have no interest in the currencies’ long-term acceptance as a way to move money</li>
					</ul>

                     <h2>4. Are cryptocurrencies a good investment?</h2>
                     <p>Cryptocurrencies may go up in value, but many investors see them as mere speculations, not real investments. The reason? Just like real currencies, cryptocurrencies generate no cash flow, so for you to profit, someone has to pay more for the currency than you did.</p>

                     <h2>5. How do I buy cryptocurrency?</h2>
                     <p>While some cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are available for purchase with U.S. dollars, others require that you pay with bitcoins or another cryptocurrency. To buy cryptocurrencies, you’ll need a “wallet,” an online app that can hold your currency. Generally, you create an account on an exchange, and then you can transfer real money to buy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Here's more on how to invest in Bitcoin. Coinbase is one popular cryptocurrency trading exchange where you can create both a wallet and buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Also, a growing number of online brokers offer cryptocurrencies, such as eToro, Tradestation and Sofi Active Investing. Robinhood offers free cryptocurrency trades (Robinhood Crypto is available in most, but not all, U.S. states).</p>

                     <h2>6. Are cryptocurrencies legal?</h2>
                    <p>There’s no question that they’re legal in the United States, though China has essentially banned their use, and ultimately whether they’re legal depends on each individual country. Also be sure to consider how to protect yourself from fraudsters who see cryptocurrencies as an opportunity to bilk investors. As always, buyer beware.</p>

                     <h2>7. How do I protect myself?</h2>
                    <p>If you’re looking to buy a cryptocurrency in an ICO, read the fine print in the company’s prospectus for this information:
                    <ul>
						<li>Who owns the company? An identifiable and well-known owner is a positive sign.</li>
						<li>Are there other major investors who are investing in it? It’s a good sign if other well-known investors want a piece of the currency.</li>
						<li>Will you own a stake in the company or just currency or tokens? This distinction is important. Owning a stake means you get to participate in its earnings (you’re an owner), while buying tokens simply means you're entitled to use them, like chips in a casino.</li>
						<li>Is the currency already developed, or is the company looking to raise money to develop it? The further along the product, the less risky it is.</li>
					</ul>
