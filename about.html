                    <h1>About Giorgos</h1>
                    <h2>A brief introduction</h2>
                    <p> I graduated from the Department of Informatics and Telecommunication (National and Kapodestrian University of Athens)
                        in 2019 and half a year later I decided to pursue an M.Sc. in Information and Communication Technologies.
                        immediately after my graduation, I started working for a large telecommunication company as part of the 
                        Digital Robotics and Automation Team. One of the reasons I decided to join your class is that part of my job 
                        requires supporting and developing legacy dashboards that provide live data to coworkers (mostly in PhP). Thus, by attending your class
                        I hope to gain new insight in Data Visualisation and propose new soluions to my teammates.</p>

                     <h1>About Panagiotis</h1>
                     <h2>A brief introduction</h2>
                     <p>Panagiotis was born in Germany a few years ago and he went to the school "Ellinogermaniki Agogi" , from where he graduated in 2007. After the high-school leaving certificate he enrolled at the University of Athens at Department of Informatics and Telecommunications.
                        He studied for 5 years, including a last semester of study at the University of Vienna as an Erasmus Exchange Student, eventually graduating with the Bachelor degree (2012).
                        He later (2016) acquired a Postgraduate degree specializing in Machine Learning, from University College London (UCL). Panagiotis at the present moment (and during the COVID-19 crisis) is attending courses , in person and online, in order to enhance further his technical and behavioral skills.
